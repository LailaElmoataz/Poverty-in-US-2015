# Poverty-in-US-2015

In this projects, I used Tableau to create multiple visuals to reveal insights from US 2015 Census Demographic Data dataset. I specifically tried to investigate the distribution of poverty across US counties in 2015, whether there is a relationship between poverty rate and job industry or sector, and the characteristics shared by the 10 poorest US states in 2015.
